Lane is a Discord/terminal chatbot designed to feel authentic and personality-driven, following in the spirit of the Twitch streamer [Neuro-sama](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987). She selectively responds to messages, maintains memory across conversations, initiates her own conversations, and can speak and listen in voice channels.

## Self-Hosting

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Required:** Anthropic API key
- **For Discord:** Discord bot application + API key
- **For RAG memory:** Qdrant API key + endpoint, and an OpenAI embeddings API key + endpoint

### 2. Configure your `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `Wizard` folder:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=         # Required
DISCORD_API_KEY=           # Required for Discord
QDRANT_API_KEY=            # Required for RAG memory
QDRANT_ENDPOINT=           # Required for RAG memory
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT= # Required for RAG memory
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=  # Required for RAG memory
AZURE_KEY=                 # Required for TTS/STT via Azure
AZURE_REGION=              # Required for TTS/STT via Azure
ELEVENLABS_KEY=            # Required for TTS via ElevenLabs
```

### 3. Configure and run

Adjust `appsettings.json` to match your setup — see [Docs/configuration.md](Docs/configuration.md) for full details. If you don't have Qdrant set up, make sure RAG memory is disabled in your config.

Then run the binary. Pass `discord` or `terminal` as a command-line argument to select the interface (defaults to `terminal`).

For a full walkthrough, see [Docs/getting_started.md](Docs/getting_started.md).
